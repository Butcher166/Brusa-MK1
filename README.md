Brusa is a project of me and my classmate we both study highschool automotive engineering we are both around the age 15 - 16 (as of 2026) by the name of this project you might think this is a parody of Prusa, however we dont intend to copy Prusa. 
Me and my coworker both appreciate what Josef Prusa has done and by no means we want to take his fame, the reason we chose this name is because of the orange filament color we are gonna use :).

Brusa is as of today 1/29/2026 nearly in middle of production, we still dont have the parts printed but we have a lot of the project made in cad (Y & X gantry assembly, bed and frame) the frame is already built from aluminium extrudes
and a bit of the electronics are built too.
With this sentence i want to give credit to our fellow designers from Voron (They are waaaay out of our league but we still consider them as our fellows because what they are trying to do for the community and i hope we can once become as helpfull as them :D)
for using their Voron switchwire skirts parts and we plan in future to use their modified StealthBurner Toolhead.

*Disclaimer*
Print this at your own risk, seriously if you burn your place down or spend money and realize this project is bad, well that aint cuz of me, you tried to build it.
However if you succeed building this monstrosity feel free to share this. If you post on instagram tag @kerlitosmtj thank you for giving time to take a look at this project.

Happy printing
